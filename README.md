# web-components
Customizable, minimal pure web components from https://coolwebcomponents.blogspot.com/.

# Important Notes!
All of these web components were developed within [CodeTMP](https://github.com/tmpmachine/codetmp) and written in [Divless-HTML format](https://github.com/tmpmachine/divless-html). It will not be rendered in any browser without using CodeTMP!

Here's a preview of what Divless-HTML format looks like :
```
<button>Button 1</button>
[ @my-div
  Divless-HTML format.
  This will be rendered as plain text bracket by any browser!
  Preview them with CodeTMP (codetmp.web.app).
]
<button>Button 2</button>
```

# Development within CodeTMP
- Copy the `raw` file to CodeTMP. You can also save the file locally then simply drag and drop the file to CodeTMP.
- Enable DivlessHTML format by going to `Settings` > `Replace Divless-HTML tag`.
- You can now preview the file and continue development within CodeTMP.

- Select the file, then click `Download` under option menu
- Check `Replace Divless-HTML tag` option, then click `Download`.
